        This is my first page in HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is not a programming language but a markup language to represent the data on HTML page.

        A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). <br> Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 
        These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
